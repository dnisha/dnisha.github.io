First lets understand how data is stored on disk.

# Data Blocks

The actual contents of files are stored in data blocks scattered across the disk. When a file is saved, the file system allocates a series of contiguous or non-contiguous blocks to store its data. These blocks may not be physically adjacent on the disk but are logically linked together through pointers in the file's metadata.
