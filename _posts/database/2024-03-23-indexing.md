First lets understand how data is stored on disk.

# Data Blocks

The actual contents of files are stored in data blocks scattered across the disk. When a file is saved, the file system allocates a series of contiguous or non-contiguous blocks to store its data. These blocks may not be physically adjacent on the disk but are logically linked together through pointers in the file's metadata.

# Indexing

In database management systems (DBMS), indexing is a technique used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on tables or views. It involves creating data structures known as indexes, which store pointers or references to rows in a table sorted based on the values of one or more columns. Here's how indexing works in DBMS.

# Index Structure

An index typically consists of two parts: the index key and the pointer to the corresponding data. The index key is the column or columns on which the index is built, and the pointer is a reference to the actual row in the table. Indexes can be built on single columns or on multiple columns (composite indexes).
