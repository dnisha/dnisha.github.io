First lets understand how data is stored on disk.

# Data Blocks

The actual contents of files are stored in data blocks scattered across the disk. When a file is saved, the file system allocates a series of contiguous or non-contiguous blocks to store its data. These blocks may not be physically adjacent on the disk but are logically linked together through pointers in the file's metadata.

# Indexing

In database management systems (DBMS), indexing is a technique used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on tables or views. It involves creating data structures known as indexes, which store pointers or references to rows in a table sorted based on the values of one or more columns. Here's how indexing works in DBMS.

# Index Structure

An index typically consists of two parts: the index key and the pointer to the corresponding data. The index key is the column or columns on which the index is built, and the pointer is a reference to the actual row in the table. Indexes can be built on single columns or on multiple columns (composite indexes).

# Types of Indexes :-

## Primary Indexing

A Primary Index is an ordered file whose records are of fixed length with two fields. The first field of the index is the primary key of the data file in an ordered manner, and the second field of the ordered file contains a block pointer that points to the data block where a record containing the key is available.

### Types of Primary Indexing

- Dense Indexing: In Dense Index has an index entry for every search key value in the data file. This approach ensures efficient data retrieval but requires more storage space.

```
No of Index Entry = No of DB Record
```

- Sparse Indexing: Sparse indexing involves having fewer index entries than records. The index entries point to blocks of records rather than individual records. While it reduces storage overhead, it may require additional disk accesses during retrieval.

```
No of Index Entry is not equal to No of Block
